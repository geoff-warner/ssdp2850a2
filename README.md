Design notes are pretty straightforward:
I prompted Claude to generate a compound gradient to simulate a sunset/twilight 
My main contribution was to demand darker and darker versions, as Claude seems to think that 'twilight' means 4 pm
Adding transparency and changing the colours from blue to purple was my idea, implemented by AI.

Somewhere around here, the screens folder and original daytime screenshot disappeared, which is somewhat confusing. 
Have you had an agent delete a directory while restyling? I can't think of another explaination...

Used Claude to confirm that contrast accessibility was maintained, then ran out of tokens, bringing an end to further styling
